;;; Commentary: 
;;
;; Bitcoin donations gratefully accepted: 1DPsbd286Xq8kch5t62DfppUbcL3e6PqnT
;;
;; How to create documentation and distribute package:
;;
;;     1) Remember to add ;;;###autoload magic cookies if possible
;;     2) Generate a bitcoin address for donations with shell command: bitcoin getaccountaddress emms-mark-ext
;;        and place address after "Commentary:" above.
;;     3) Use org-readme-top-header-to-readme to create initial Readme.org file.
;;     4) Use M-x auto-document to insert descriptions of commands and documents
;;     5) Create documentation in the Readme.org file:
;;        - Use org-mode features for structuring the data.
;;        - Divide the commands into different categories and create headings
;;          containing org lists of the commands in each category.
;;        - Create headings with any other extra information if needed (e.g. customization).
;;     6) In this buffer use org-readme-to-commentary to fill Commentary section with
;;        documentation from Readme.org file.
;;     7) Make any necessary adjustments to the documentation in this file (e.g. remove the installation
;;        and customization sections added in previous step since these should already be present).
;;     8) Use org-readme-marmalade-post and org-readme-convert-to-emacswiki to post
;;        the library on Marmalade and EmacsWiki respectively.

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;  `emms-mark-mark-tagged'
;;    Mark all tracks whose TAG field matches REGEXP.
;;  `emms-tag-editor-alter-notes-tag'
;;    Alter arbitrary word tags to the info-note tag of tracks.
;;  `emms-tag-editor-clear-field'
;;    Clear contents of a field for all tracks in tags editor.
;;

;;; Commentary:

;; `emms-mark-mark-tagged' can be used to mark based on a tag. It works at
;; `emms-mark-mode', if it's not in `emms-mark-mode', `emms-mark-mode' will 
;; be turned on automatically.

;; When in `emms-mark-mode', the following keybindings are defined for search
;; based on tags:
;; '/ m'    `emms-mark-mark-tagged'

;; `emms-tag-editor-alter-notes-tag' can be used to add/remove word from
;; tracks info-note tag. And the added tag will be separated by ":".



;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put emms-mark-ext.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'emms-mark-ext)

;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;
;;  `emms-tag-editor-notes-word-list'
;;    List of default words for the info-note field of the emms-tag-editor buffer.
;;    default = nil

;;
;; All of the above can customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET emms-mark-ext RET
;;

;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2013/05/28
;;      * Updated for upload to Marmalade 
;;
;; 2010
;;      * First released.
